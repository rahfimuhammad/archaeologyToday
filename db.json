It was characterized by the use of stone tools by early humans and marked a critical phase in human development. During this era, the use of stone tools began with the incidental use of tools by utilizing natural rocks that had sharp edges. It was only then that humans started to shape stone tools in a simple way to get a tool shape that was quite specific. Several types of tools that were quite common at this time included chopping axes, scraping axes, and hand axes.",

They relied on animal husbandry for sustenance, utilizing the resources provided by their livestock for food, clothing, and shelter. Nomads were skilled in navigating diverse landscapes, adapting to harsh environments, and maintaining a deep understanding of seasonal cycles. This lifestyle fostered a strong sense of community and resilience, as they formed close-knit kinship networks and traded goods with settled societies.
